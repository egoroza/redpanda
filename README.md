# Red Panda Town
Red Panda Town is a small social networking website/demo that I've created from scratch. It is inspired by several social networking websites, notably Facebook. I have coded the entire site from scratch using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and am using mySQL to store database information.

Notable Bugs (updated 7/12/2016):

- PHP mail function sends activation e-mail to spam inbox

Finished:

- Registering users to the database
- Allowing users to login
- Allowing users to change their email/password
- Users may makes "posts"
